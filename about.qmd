# Who I am?

My name is Liwei Jiang. You can call me Tony if you like.

Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in Public Policy at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy, specializing in energy and environmental policy. I obtained my undergraduate degree in Chemistry from the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, and subsequently worked in various industries such as e-commerce, exports, and education for three years.

Realizing climate change presents both challenges and opportunities, I decided to applied for Duke's public policy program. My aim is to integrate my private sector experience into public policy, with the goal of mobilizing more resources to combat climate change, facilitate the transition to clean energy, and unlock development opportunities.
